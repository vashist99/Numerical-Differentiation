# Numerical-Differentiation
This repository implements numerical differentiation methods on cos(x) and e^(x) in C++

## How does it work?
- This project implements Forward difference, backward difference, and interpolated difference on an automatically generated data set
with different interval sizes (H).

## How to run?
- Use:
```
g++ -std=c++17 cosx.cpp
```
or
```
g++ cosx.cpp
```

to run the difference methods on cos(x)

- Use:
```
g++ -std=c++17 ex.cpp
```
or
```
g++ ex.cpp
```

to run the difference methods on e^(x)
